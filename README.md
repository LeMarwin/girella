This is a fork of original Girella with the versions bumped up to the lts-13.3 resolver. Some fixes were applied. Example still works, so I hope it won't fire missiles.

This is a repository with experimental [opaleye](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye) additions, some of it may eventually get merged into opaleye while other parts are too opiniated for that.
